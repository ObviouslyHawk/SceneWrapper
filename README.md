# SceneWrapper
Click on any SceneAsset and click "Create Scene Wrapper" to create scene wrapper for it.
Use this asset as you would SceneManager, but without using any string literals as it already contains all necessary data.
SceneWrapper automatically updates when scene is renamed or when scene build index is changed.
